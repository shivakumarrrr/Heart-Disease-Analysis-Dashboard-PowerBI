# Heart-Disease-Analysis-Dashboard-PowerBI
Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing heart disease patient data based on survival rate, age group, gender, and health conditions.

This project features an interactive dashboard built using **Power BI** to analyze and visualize heart disease patient data. It provides actionable insights into patient survival rates, age group trends, gender-based analysis, and the impact of critical health conditions like smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, and anemia.

# Dataset Used
- [Download Dataset](https://github.com/shivakumarrrr/HR-Analytics-Dashboard-PowerBI/blob/main/HR%20Analysis%20Dataset.xlsx).

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard visualizes key metrics and comparisons across different age groups, including:
- **Survival Rate**
- **Average Age at Survival**
- **Total Survivors vs Deaths**
- **Impact of Lifestyle & Health Conditions**

## Key Insights

- **Survival Rate by Age Group:** Shows survival trends by age.
- **Ejection Fraction vs Death Event:** Identifies weak heart performance in higher-risk groups.
- **Creatinine Levels:** Higher levels linked to lower survival in older age groups.
- **Impact of Smoking, Diabetes, Anaemia, and BP:** Combined effect shown via Sankey-style chart.
  **Gender Toggle:** Filter-based male/female survival comparison.


## Tools & Technologies Used

- Power BI Desktop  
- Power Query  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)  
- Data Modeling
